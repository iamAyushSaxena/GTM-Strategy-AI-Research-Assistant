✅ STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. PRICING TIER STRATEGY
   • Launch with 3 tiers: Free, Pro ($15), Team ($30)
   • Free tier is generous (50 documents) to drive virality
   • Pro tier targets individual researchers (80% of market)
   • Team tier for research labs (20% of market, 2x ARPU)

2. FREE-TO-PAID CONVERSION
   • Target: 10% conversion rate in first 6 months
   • Tactics: Email nurture, usage-based upgrades, social proof
   • Trigger: When user hits 50 document limit or needs citation export

3. PRICING TESTS TO RUN
   • Test $12 vs $15 vs $18 for Pro tier
   • Test annual discount (20% vs 25% vs 30%)
   • Test freemium limit (25 vs 50 vs 100 documents)

4. ANNUAL PREPAY INCENTIVE
   • Offer 20% discount for annual prepay ($144 vs $180)
   • Improves cash flow and reduces churn
   • Target 40% of paid users on annual plans

5. REGIONAL PRICING STRATEGY (INDIA FOCUS)
   • Problem: Standard $15/mo is high friction for Indian market (~₹1,250)
   • Strategy: Implement Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) pricing
   • Offer: Pro Plan at ₹499/month (approx $6) for users in India
   • Rationale: Lower barrier to entry for large volume of Indian PhD scholars
   • Impact: Increases adoption in the beachhead market while maintaining global ARPU
